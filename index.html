<p>This software will only run on a Linux box.</p>

<h3>
<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>Boolean satisfiability problems are known for being among the first problems to be defined as NP-complete.  In 2002, Ravinderjit S. Braich, Nickolas Chelyapov, Cliff Johnson, Paul W. K. Rothemund, and Leonard Adleman solved a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/296/5567/499.abstract">20-Variable 3-SAT problem using a DNA computer</a>.  This computer used massive parallelism made possible through DNA computing to search all 2^20 possible solutions to find the one correct solution in a non-exponential number of steps.  The software in this GitHub project is designed to come up with a set of DNA strands that can be used in a DNA computer similar to theirs.</p>

<h3>
<a id="problem-description" class="anchor" href="#problem-description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem Description</h3>

<p>The goal of the project is to input a 3-SAT problem and output a set of DNA strands that can represent the true and false states of each of the unique variables in the 3-SAT problem.  In order to create such a library of DNA strands, the DNA strands have to meet certain requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each variable in the 3-SAT problem will be represented by a unique pair of unique DNA sequences: one of the pair represents False, the other represents True.</li>
<li>Each unique DNA strand in the library must not bind to itself.</li>
<li>Each unique DNA strand in the library must not bind to other strands in the library.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="why-it-matters" class="anchor" href="#why-it-matters" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why It Matters</h3>

<p>This project is important because there are many cases in DNA computing besides this one where DNA strands that have the above mentioned properties are desirable.  In order to represent a concept using a DNA strand, that DNA strand has to be unique, stable, and combine predictably.  Other DNA computers such as ones using toe-hold mediated strand displacement must have DNA strands with these properties.  Unexpected side reactions can easily break a DNA computer.  The self-assembly attribute of DNA strands is what makes DNA computing work, but it is simultaneously what makes the design of such computers hard.</p>

<h3>
<a id="demonstration" class="anchor" href="#demonstration" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Demonstration</h3>

<p>We begin with creating an input file.  The 3-SAT file contains a 3-SAT equation in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).  </p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magicarrow2/CS-6600-DNA-Project/gh-pages/images/Input%20File.jpeg" alt="input file"></p>

<p>To make this work, the compiled jar file must be located in the same folder that the nupack4.0.3 folder is in.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magicarrow2/CS-6600-DNA-Project/gh-pages/images/Demo2.png" alt="demo2"></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magicarrow2/CS-6600-DNA-Project/gh-pages/images/Demo%202%20Output%20File.jpeg" alt="demo 2 output file"></p>

<p>The program will try to get a 3-SAT equation from the user even if an input file is not given.</p>
