<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>Boolean satisfiability problems are known for being among the first problems to be defined as NP-complete.  In 2002, Ravinderjit S. Braich, Nickolas Chelyapov, Cliff Johnson, Paul W. K. Rothemund, and Leonard Adleman solved a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/296/5567/499.abstract">20-Variable 3-SAT problem using a DNA computer</a>.  This computer used massive parallelism made possible through DNA computing to search all 2^20 possible solutions to find the one correct solution in a non-exponential number of steps.  The software in this GitHub project is designed to come up with a set of DNA strands that can be used in a DNA computer similar to theirs.</p>

<h3>
<a id="problem-description" class="anchor" href="#problem-description" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem Description</h3>


<p>The goal of the project is to determine the utility of using a hill climbing algorithm to design DNA sequences useful for creating a DNA computer.</p>

<p>The goal of the code is to input a 3-SAT problem and output a set of DNA strands that can represent the true and false states of each of the unique variables in the 3-SAT problem.  In order to create such a library of DNA strands, the DNA strands have to meet certain requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each variable in the 3-SAT problem will be represented by a unique pair of unique DNA sequences: one of the pair represents False, the other represents True.</li>
<li>Each unique DNA strand in the library must not bind to itself.</li>
<li>Each unique DNA strand in the library must not bind to other strands in the library.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="why-it-matters" class="anchor" href="#why-it-matters" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why It Matters</h3>

<p>This project is important because there are many cases in DNA computing besides this one where DNA strands that have the above mentioned properties are desirable.  In order to represent a concept using a DNA strand, that DNA strand has to be unique, stable, and combine predictably.  Other DNA computers such as ones using toe-hold mediated strand displacement must have DNA strands with these properties.  Unexpected side reactions can easily break a DNA computer.  The self-assembly attribute of DNA strands is what makes DNA computing work, but it is simultaneously what makes the design of such computers hard.</p>

<h3>
<a id="demonstration" class="anchor" href="#demonstration" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Demonstration</h3>

<p>We begin with creating an input file.  The 3-SAT file contains a 3-SAT equation in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).</p> 

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magicarrow2/CS-6600-DNA-Project/gh-pages/images/Big%20Input%20File.jpeg" alt="big input file"></p>

<p>To make this work, the compiled jar file must be located in the same folder that the nupack4.0.3 folder is in.  The program is run with "java -jar StickerModelJava.jar [inputFile] [outputFile] [timeLimitinSeconds]".  All of the arguments are optional, but are position based.  If -h is used for the argument, the program displays a help page.  With no arguments, the program will ask for an input file or 3-SAT equation from the user.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magicarrow2/CS-6600-DNA-Project/gh-pages/images/DNA%20Compiler%20GUI.jpeg" alt="gui"></p>

<p>The program will run for some time then output the results to the screen and to the file specified in the command arguments.  If no output file was specified, the results will be found in a file named "Results.txt".</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magicarrow2/CS-6600-DNA-Project/gh-pages/images/Big%20Output%20File.jpeg" alt="big output file"></p>

<p>The probability of straigtness and not combining is given as a number between 0.0 and 1.0.  As seen in this demonstration, 10 seconds is not long enough to find a valid solution.</p>

<h3>
<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How It Works</h3>

<p>This program uses a hill climbing algorithm with simulated annealing to find the solution.  The initial solution is chosen randomly.  The probability of the equilibrium structure of the DNA strands being straight and non-hybridizing is the value used to score the solution.  Mutations in the solution are applied to the strand with the most hybridizing bases.  Mutations are made in one of two ways: a nucleotide in a hybridization area is changed or an entire strand is replaced with a random strand.  The method of mutation is chosen randomly.  The annealing part of the algorithm slowly reduces the probability of replacing an entire strand and increases the probability of changing only a single nucleotide.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nupack.org/">NuPack DNA analytics software</a> is used to find the probability of hybridization and the lowest energy secondary structure (equilibrium structure) of the DNA strands.</p>
