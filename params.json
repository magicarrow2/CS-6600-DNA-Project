{"name":"CS 6600 DNA Computing Project","tagline":"This is a project for a master's class for turning a 3-SAT into a set of unique, straight, non-combining DNA strands representing the true and false states of the variables in the 3-SAT problem.","body":"### Word of Caution\r\nThis software is still under construction and is not yet in a useful state.\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nBoolean satisfiability problems are known for being among the first problems to be defined as NP-complete.  In 2002, Ravinderjit S. Braich, Nickolas Chelyapov, Cliff Johnson, Paul W. K. Rothemund, and Leonard Adleman solved a [20-Variable 3-SAT problem using a DNA computer](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/296/5567/499.abstract).  This computer used massive parallelism made possible through DNA computing to search all 2^20 possible solutions to find the one correct solution in linear time.  The software in this GitHub project is designed to come up with a set of DNA strands that can be used in a DNA computer similar to theirs.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\nThis project was started as a project for a CS6600 Intelligent Systems class.  The application incorporates calls to the [NuPack DNA analytics software](http://www.nupack.org/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
